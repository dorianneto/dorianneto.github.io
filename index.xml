      <description>Hi there üëã!
My name is Dorian Neto, I&amp;rsquo;m 30 years old&amp;rsquo;s Brazilian and I was born and raised in Fortaleza, CE. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m living in Newfoundland &amp;amp; Labrador, Canada and working as a Senior Software Engineer at HeyOrca üê≥.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working since 2011 as a developer and this makes me feel fulfilled ‚ù§Ô∏è. Among the several ideas that I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated about in the area, resolving business problems by designing and developing scalable, consistent, concise, and fast digital solutions is what makes my eyes light up ‚≠ê.</description>
