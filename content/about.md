Hi there :wave:

My name is Dorian Neto, I'm 31 years old's Brazilian and I was born and raised in Fortaleza, CE. Currently, I'm living in [Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada](https://goo.gl/maps/eGP98tZ28c6jEUu87) and working as a Lead Software Developer at [Enaimco](https://enaimco.com/).

I've been working since 2011 as a developer and this makes me feel fulfilled :heart:. Among the several ideas that I'm fascinated about in the area, **resolving business problems by designing and developing scalable, consistent, concise, and fast digital solutions** is what makes my eyes light up :star:.
